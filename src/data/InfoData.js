    "Be'er Sheva is one of the oldest cities in Israel and its first settlers lived there about 6000 years ago. Modern Be'er Sheva was built by the State of Israel as the capital of the Negev and as a symbol of making the desert bloom.",
  paragraphTwo:
    "Between the late 1950s and early 1980s, the city was a kind of active lab for urban planning in which many daring experiments were carried out, some of which ended in utter failure. During this period, a large number of brutalist-style buildings were constructed in Be'er Sheva - including residential, administrative, educational, culture and entertainment structures. these buildings were connected by common features, such as shapes sculpted in the massive raw concrete façades.",

    "Brutalism, also known as Brutalist architecture, is a style that emerged in the 1950s and grew out of the early-20th century modernist movement. The movement began to decline in the 1970s, having been much criticised for being unwelcoming and inhuman.",
  paragraphTwo:
    "The Brutalist architecture of Be'er Sheva is rooted in a unique environment and in a distinct context: the desert and its many physical and cultural layers. Beer Sheva, which is presented in future plans as Israel's next metropolis, is unlike any other metropolis - Tel Aviv and Jerusalem - with its own individuality, including through its brutalist landscape.",
