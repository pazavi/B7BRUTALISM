The building was constructed following an initiative by local businessmen, who wanted to establish a cinema in Be'er Sheva in the Alef neighborhood. Following Mayor David Tuviahu's request, the initiative was transferred to Gimmel Neighborhood.",
      "The location chosen for the project was in the center of the neighborhood, next to the commercial center and the neighborhood park. Plans were commissioned for the design of the project from the office of the architect Zeev Rechter, while the project was entrusted to the architect Yaakov Rechter.",
      "Rechter designed the building using basic shapes like triangles and rhombuses and bare concrete in the main and rear facades, which gave the building its impressive appearance. The hall itself was designed quite simply and well met the needs of the residents during its years of operation.",
      "The cinema was inaugurated under the name Orot Hanegev but was soon shortened to Orot. In January 1960, the 800-seat auditorium was inaugurated, with the screening of the film The Bridge over the River Kwai. The cinema was an economic success and its operators soon decided to establish another cinema in the city - an amphitheater, which was an open and roofless cinema. Amphitheater opened in 1963.",
      "Orot Cinema operated for 30 years less a week. On December 31, 1989, the last screening took place. After its closure, the cinema was sold to local developer, but for years there was a dispute between the buyer and the Be'er Sheva municipality over the amount of the payment. In 2002, a compromise was reached regarding the price of the deal and the developer began to promote the construction of a residential project in place of the cinema building. However, it became clear that the sale transaction had not been approved by the Ministry of the Interior and therefore the transaction did not materialize.",
      "In February 2020, a solution began to emerge, according to which the developer will sell the lease rights to the area and the cinema building, back to the Be'er Sheva municipality for the purpose of renovating the building and constructing additional buildings around it. Under the agreement, the Beer Sheva municipality was required to pay compensation of up to NIS 14 million due to the breach of contract to the developer. \nToday the building stands abandoned and ruined. With the increase in awareness of cultural assets in the city, a struggle of residents for the preservation of the Orot cinema building began.",

      "The motivation for the construction of the project began as a counter-reaction to the master plan prepared by the architect Arie Sharon for Beer Sheva (and all of Israel) in the early 1950s. The plan divided the city into several neighborhoods with independent centers separated by wide roads. Sharon wanted to see Be'er Sheva become a green and prosperous \"garden city\" in accordance with the modernist ideology that dominated the planning world. Instead of densification he outlined scattering, instead of shady streets he designed huge empty areas that were left unused. In practice, this plan prevented Be'er Sheva from having a real urban atmosphere, and turned it all into a kind of suburb.",
      'In the article "Architecture of Shadow" published in the "Kav" monthly in 1965, Ram Carmi gave an extensive manifesto on the problematic nature of modern urban planning in Israel and spoke of the "Negev Center" as a possible typical solution for Beer Sheva: "(This is) a building that tries to be a tier from which, you can, perhaps, grow an urban texture. A tier that will be a \'place\' and contain a microcosm of urban activity."',
      'Carmi designed an elongated building with an east-west orientation in the center of which is a covered street "in a triangular section of a tent", as he puts it. On the ground floor are shops, with offices above them, and on the third and fourth floors are residential apartments, some in a duplex configuration. At both ends of the street he placed squares and next to them public and commercial buildings such as a supermarket, a cinema and a school.',
      "It is a concept that is somewhat reminiscent of the design principles of a typical mall, with anchor stores placed at the edges and encouraging movement throughout the space.",
      "Inside the shaded street are two public staircases that cut out the long perspective and enrich the view. Four additional staircases are placed on the outside of the building. The stairs get smaller as they climb up until they are finally used by groups of only four apartments.",

After construction delays, the new building was inaugurated in 1972, and in the same year it was incorporated into the new city emblem.",

      "The second element is a narrow, high observation tower, made of concrete, placed in front of the building. An elevator was installed in the tower, but today the ascent to the tower is blocked and it serves only as an antenna carrier. It was originally planned to place a work of art by the sculptor Yechiel Shemi at the top of the tower, with whom the architects collaborated on the Jerusalem Theater building, but it was canceled due to a lack of budget.",
